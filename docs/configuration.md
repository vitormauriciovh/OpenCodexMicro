# Configuration

The OpenCodexMicro layout is configured entirely in Ulanzi Studio. Open the
Codex Micro category and drag any action onto a keypad position.

Select any configured action to open the shared **Codex Bridge Setup** page.
The page distinguishes the wrapper app installation, Bridge background
service, and Codex CDP connection. It can install or repair the Bridge from
resources bundled with the plugin, launch Codex Bridge, and recheck status.
No repository or npm working directory is required for this flow.

## Actions

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Codex Task 1–5 | Show the matching Most Recent task title and state (including live elapsed time when running); press to open it |
| Fast | Toggle Fast mode for the active task |
| Usage | Show remaining usage allowance and reset countdown; press to focus Codex |
| Approve | One-touch approve pending command or tool action in the active thread |
| Deny | One-touch reject / cancel pending tool call in the active thread |
| Attention Alert | Display count of threads needing approval or intervention; press to switch directly to the pending thread |
| Pin | Pin or unpin the active task |
| New | Create a new Codex task |
| Latest Task & Scroll (Encoder) | Press to open task 1; turn left/right to send mouse-wheel up/down through the Ulanzi hotkey protocol |
| Fork | Fork the active task |
| Steer | Send the visible composer text as steering input to a running task |
| Mic | Press and release the Codex Micro microphone action |
| Submit | Submit or queue the composer text |

Task actions dynamically use the plugin's idle, working, complete, attention,
error, and offline artwork. Usage is rendered at runtime from the allowance
returned by the Bridge. The Encoder action mirrors task 1's current title and
status artwork.

## Recommended layout

Keep Task 1–5 together in Most Recent order. Place frequently used controls on
the remaining keys; the layout is not hard-coded, and the same action can be
placed on more than one key.

## Runtime requirements

- Start Codex through `~/Applications/Codex Bridge.app`.
- Keep the Bridge sidecar running at `127.0.0.1:17373`.
- Allow Ulanzi Studio under macOS System Settings > Privacy & Security >
  Accessibility so the Encoder can emit mouse-wheel events.
- Restart Ulanzi Studio after installing a new plugin build.

The plugin does not require a separate device service, shortcut file, or theme
configuration. To change shipped artwork, edit the files under
`integration/com.ulanzi.codexmicro.ulanziPlugin/assets/icons/`, rebuild, and
reinstall the plugin.
