# OpenCodexMicro

**Control Codex Desktop from an Ulanzi D200 Series through Ulanzi Studio.**

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

OpenCodexMicro exposes Codex's live Micro state through a loopback Bridge and
turns it into a native Ulanzi Studio plugin. It shows recent tasks, switches to
the exact task displayed on a key, and provides Fast, Usage, Pin, New, Fork,
Steer, Mic, Submit, and Latest Task & Scroll Encoder actions.

## What it does

| Feature | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Five live task actions | Show Codex's Most Recent tasks with idle, working, complete, attention, or error state |
| Exact task switching | Route the selected thread through Codex's own Micro event bus |
| Codex controls | Fast, Usage, Pin, New, Fork, Steer, Mic, and Submit |
| Encoder navigation | Press to open task 1; turn left/right to scroll up/down through Ulanzi Studio's hotkey protocol |
| Live usage | Draw the remaining Codex allowance directly on the key; press to return to Codex |
| Ulanzi Studio integration | Let Ulanzi Studio own the device and manage the key layout |
| Local-only transport | Bind CDP and the Bridge API to loopback addresses only |

This Ulanzi-maintained project is an unofficial integration with Codex Desktop
for **macOS, Ulanzi Studio, and Ulanzi D200 Series**. It is not affiliated with or
endorsed by OpenAI. The entire project was vibe-coded with Codex.

Ulanzi's implementation and maintenance scope is limited to
`integration/com.ulanzi.codexmicro.ulanziPlugin/`. The plugin only consumes
state and action interfaces exposed through the existing local Bridge; Ulanzi
did not participate in the design, specification, development, or maintenance
of CDP or Codex's CDP implementation. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for the full
responsibility boundary.

## Installation

### Installation environment

- macOS 13 or later;
- Codex Desktop;
- Ulanzi Studio 3.0.1 or later;
- Ulanzi D200 Series connected to Ulanzi Studio;
- Node.js 20 or newer only for repository-based manual installation.

### 1. LLM / Agent installation

An LLM or coding agent must follow these steps:

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and inspect the installed Ulanzi Studio plugin
   manifests under `~/Library/Application Support/Ulanzi/UlanziDeck/Plugins/`.
2. Treat Codex Micro as installed only when manifest UUID
   `com.ulanzi.ulanzistudio.codexmicro` is present and its `CodePath` exists.
3. If it is missing or invalid, load
   [`$install-ulanzi-studio-plugin`](skills/install-ulanzi-studio-plugin/SKILL.md),
   install the plugin, and verify its manifest and entry point.
4. After the plugin is verified, load
   [`$setup-codex-bridge`](skills/setup-codex-bridge/SKILL.md), install or repair
   `Codex Bridge.app` and its sidecar, and verify the local health endpoint.
5. Report plugin installation and Bridge connectivity separately. Do not
   reinstall a valid plugin unless an update or repair was requested.

### 2. Install Bridge from Ulanzi Studio

After installing the Codex Micro plugin, drag any Codex Micro action onto a
key and select it. Its shared **Codex Bridge Setup** page can:

- show whether `Codex Bridge.app`, the Bridge service, and CDP are available;
- install or repair the bundled Bridge without a repository or npm directory;
- launch `~/Applications/Codex Bridge.app`; and
- recheck the connection or open the full installation guide.

The installer writes only to the current user's Applications, Application
Support, and LaunchAgents directories and does not require `sudo`.

### 3. Manual installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UlanziTechnology/OpenCodexMicro.git
cd OpenCodexMicro
npm install
npm run install:plugin
npm run setup
```

Quit Ulanzi Studio before running `npm run install:plugin`. The command
validates and atomically installs the prebuilt plugin. `npm run setup` builds
the loopback Bridge sidecar, registers its user LaunchAgent, and installs
`Codex Bridge.app` in `~/Applications`.

Reopen Ulanzi Studio. Quit Codex Desktop, then open
`~/Applications/Codex Bridge.app`; the wrapper starts Codex with a
loopback-only CDP endpoint. Confirm the connection with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:17373/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:17373/state
```

In Ulanzi Studio, drag the Codex Micro actions onto the desired keys. See
[Setup and operations](docs/setup-and-operations.md) for installed paths,
diagnostics, updates, and uninstall instructions.

> **Important:** When using Codex Micro, always launch Codex through
> `~/Applications/Codex Bridge.app`. Do not open Codex Desktop directly.
>
> Launch command:
>
> ```bash
> open ~/Applications/Codex\ Bridge.app
> ```

## Configure

The physical layout is managed in Ulanzi Studio. The plugin ships these
actions: Codex Task 1–5, Fast, Usage, Pin, New, Fork, Steer, Mic, Submit, and
Latest Task & Scroll for Encoder controls.
No separate device daemon or shortcut mapping is required.

Select any configured action to open the shared **Codex Bridge Setup** page.
It shows Bridge installation, service, and CDP status and provides Install /
Repair and Launch controls.

On macOS, enable Ulanzi Studio in **System Settings > Privacy & Security >
Accessibility** so Encoder rotation can send mouse-wheel events.

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for action behavior and layout
guidance.

The repository includes two reusable Codex skills:

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`setup-codex-bridge`](skills/setup-codex-bridge/SKILL.md) | Install, update, verify, or repair `Codex Bridge.app` and its sidecar |
| [`install-ulanzi-studio-plugin`](skills/install-ulanzi-studio-plugin/SKILL.md) | Install the repository's prebuilt plugin directory into Ulanzi Studio |
